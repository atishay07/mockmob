# Owner feedback, 31 Oct 2026 about 5:20 pm IST: Learn and Key cards on the live website

He checked Key cards himself on www.mockmob.in after they went live (flag on at 1:35 pm).

## Verbatim
> Some parts are good and some are very confusing.
>
> * The journey to reach the keycard section is itself not very well placed and very small.
> * Just like in accountancy, when I select your part, it glitches sometimes and shuffles it. It's a bit buggy.
> * The interface regarding all of the things that you have built in the Learn section is itself not very good or easy to use.
> * Once we even get into a specific card or chapter (or whatever this is, like Accounting Partnership, Accounting Partnership Basic Concepts), in the Read section it's a very weird layout.
> * The Study section is the only part I like. It's exactly what we wanted but that also should maybe have some animation or something. When I press Got It and when there is that Print That Chapter Sheet, it's maybe a good idea but it should have our watermark all over the place so that no one can copy it. This is not watermark content but still we are Fitzmeen downloading.
> * This last Look, I really didn't understand. What's the difference between this and the Read section? It's a bit confusing.
> * All this should be integrated better, more tastefully, and more in the flow.
> * This overall Learn section needs easier self-control rather than just being based on focusing upon the weaknesses and all. If someone is trying to figure out things there, it's very confusing.
> * The Learn section should be according to this flow I am giving you as an example: someone comes in, they select a subject, they select the concept that they have to practice, and then there are many things lined up there. They select the time for which they want to practice and there are some combinations of cards and questions lined up for them. There is also a separate section that easily shows them what exactly to find where or, if they want to, separately revise something, some specific cards, and something else.
> * All of this, you have to think about how to integrate everything properly and make a good UI/UX. There should not be just lines and lines of text and stuff like that everywhere, an overload of information with no clear next action. Even the next clear action that you have is not dynamic. It's just one thing that it is showing, with no more options.
> * This is not a poor requirement but still this is far from what we are looking to do. These cards and everything are the core area for the Learn thing, the entire Learn area, so it should be better, as I said. Then you can integrate it in the Explore section also, maybe creating a customized feed for practicing a chapter, like starting a 10-minute lesson. It just shows randomly some practice cards, MCQ stuff like that, so everything has to be thoughtful. You have to think it through, which you are not doing right now.
>
> Pick up this direction and start working on this and making better progress. Honestly, I have not seen the quality of the overall cards. They seem decent to me, but everything just has a "must know" mark to it, which makes it kind of weird. Okay, not everything has it, but multiple things have it. These can be changed or something. For many of these things, you have to spend longer time thinking these through. And I'm giving you the basic direction, so ideate better on all of this.

Transcription guesses (confirm): "Fitzmeen downloading" probably means "preventing downloading" or "we are fine with them downloading, but it must carry our mark". "Accounting Partnership Basic Concepts" is the chapter "Accounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts".

## Items (folded into OWNER-MASTER-LEDGER.md, section "Learn and Key cards, 31 Oct evening")
| ID | Item |
|---|---|
| LK1 | The way to Key cards is badly placed and too small. |
| LK2 | Bug: choosing "Your part" (Accountancy) sometimes glitches and reorders the options. |
| LK3 | The Learn section as a whole is not good or easy to use. |
| LK4 | Read mode inside a chapter has a weird layout. |
| LK5 | Study mode is right ("exactly what we wanted"); add motion, for example on Got it. |
| LK6 | Print chapter sheet: keep it, but put the MockMob watermark all over it so it can't be copied. |
| LK7 | Last look vs Read is unclear. |
| LK8 | Integrate everything better, more tastefully, in the flow. |
| LK9 | Learn must give the student easy control of their own study, not only weakness-led steering; it is confusing to find things. |
| LK10 | The flow: pick a subject, pick the concept or chapter, see what is lined up, pick a time, get a mix of cards and questions. Plus a separate place that shows what is where and lets them revise specific cards or anything else they choose. |
| LK11 | No walls of text or information overload; the next action must be clear and dynamic, with options, not one fixed suggestion. |
| LK12 | Cards are the core of the whole Learn area. Also bring them to Explore: a custom feed to practise a chapter (for example a 10-minute run mixing cards and MCQs). Think it through. |
| LK13 | Too many cards carry "Must-know"; change it. |
| LK14 | Spend longer thinking; ideate better. |


## 31 Oct 2026, about 11:20 pm IST: his answers to A9 and N1 (verbatim)

1. The explore feed can be free but up to a certain limit or something. You can think of some freemium kind of thing.
2. The sidebar: I have been thinking about this previously and we were also thinking about this. Right now I was also thinking about how to integrate it. The current structure was good: one practice tab, then below it some study features in Mob. I think the learn section itself has now expanded a lot, so we can make it into another part. It would lead to more buttons and more sections. Maybe it won't be a very big problem on the website, but it will be a huge problem to integrate it properly in the app, as we can't expand the navbar more. Think about how you can do it.
If I check the current learn section, I don't know if you have committed any changes. I don't see any changes exactly and am not sure at all what you have done. I don't see any changes at all, so I am not going to judge anything or comment on anything else right now.

**Folded in:**
- **LK15 (A9):** questions in the feed and in Learn sessions are free up to a limit.
  - CTO rule: Free gets one Learn session a day, either a chapter run or the Explore feed, up to 10 minutes, with its questions free. The card limits stay as they are.
  - Explore's plain question swipe stays unlimited, as it is today.
  - Pro gets any number of sessions, of any length.
  - The limit line shows only when he hits the limit.
- **LK16 (N1):** Learn becomes its own section, without adding a slot to the app's bar. The spec is in learn-1031/NAV-2.md on branch web/1031-learn-v2, rendered as `&nav=n2`.
- **LK17:** he could not see any change. Nothing is deployed. The build runs only in the local preview, so it was opened for him in the app's browser pane.


## 31 Oct 2026, about 11:50 pm IST: his verdict on the nav v2 renders (verbatim)

I feel like the website integration might be fine, but the issue is, if you see the old app, we already have the segregation for Practice, Your Paper, and Learn. Learn is kind of its own tab already, and just having Find and Device, which we have segregated in Learn, even on the website, also doesn't make much sense. What extra are we adding by making Learn a new tab?

I was thinking that if you have to add multiple tabs to it, and only if that's necessary, then you could think about having Learn as an extra tab. Explore already had its own tab and was different, so I don't know. It doesn't make much sense right now, especially if you are planning to split them up. In the app, it's looking very weird. The current implementation looks way cleaner.

Of course, we might not be able to incorporate Find, Learn, and all those kinds of things there. To be honest with you, I currently don't know what the best approach is. Maybe we can remove the Explore and Find kinds of things from the phone, but I also want to keep the Explore feed and make it a very cool feature on the mobile app. I'm not sure right now, and from these mockups, I can't tell much either. If you can build something, or if you have an actual live prototype on that, only then can I comment more.

**Folded in:**
- **LK16 is closed.** Nav v2 (n2) is rejected and reverted. The current navigation stays: Learn is a door in Practice, and on the website Learn is first under Practice. The record is learn-1031/NAV-2.md.
- **LK18:** the Explore feed becomes a standout phone feature. Find moves inside Learn as a search field, and stops being a separate toggle.
- **LK19:** he judges only live prototypes, so he gets a link he can open on his phone, not static mock-ups.
  - Spec: learn-1031/FEED-2.md on branch web/1031-learn-v2.


## 1 Nov 2026, about 1:25 am IST: his look at the live prototype, on the computer (verbatim)

I have opened him right now on the computer only not on the phone but I think they are enough for the feedback.

The first one, the feed: I really like the direction but I don't know if this was made for phone purposes only. On PC there is no way to go on to the next thing. I know you are trying something like a story but it's just stuck on one thing with too much blank space everywhere.

Explore with chapter covers: I really love the things you have built and the direction that you are taking. If you are doing it for accountancy and chapter fields are all showing just the accountancy logos, it doesn't make much sense and can be replaced with something else.

When I went inside and checked in the Learn section, if we go to any specific chapter and then practice it, it is quite good. The customization according to the time adjusts the questions and all. The direction is there but can be refined a lot. That part is missing and overall many things have too much blank space or need a lot of UI refinement. Still I would say.

Right now your task is to build this feature completely and test out everything, including any issues that are there and how everything can be perfected. We have the systems around it. We need to really refine and think about the UI/UX of this entire thing, the entire logic behind it, and making it more useful. All this should be done right now. Then let me know what you need from me or what exactly my next steps are.

**Folded in:**
- **LK20:** the feed on a computer has no way to the next item ("stuck on one thing") and too much blank space. He likes the direction.
- **LK21:** he loves the Explore covers' direction, but every Accountancy cover shows the same Accountancy object. Replace it with something chapter-specific.
- **LK22:** the chapter run in Learn (pick a chapter, pick a time, the mix adjusts) is "quite good". The direction is right but needs a lot of refinement; many screens have too much blank space.
- **LK23:** build the whole feature completely now: test everything, fix every issue, refine the UI/UX and the logic, make it more useful, using the systems already around it. Then tell him what is needed from him and his next steps.


## 1 Nov 2026, about 4:05 pm IST: his first live look at Learn v2, the Explore feed and the home page (verbatim)

> Okay, I can give you brief feedback only right now. I didn't have much time, but I think you will get some direction from it and see what exactly to do.
>
> * The UI on the phone, the website part, is a bit too cluttered. I am talking about the web mobile experience, not the mobile app. I have not seen what you have done on the mobile app that you can do yourself.
> * When the Google Play Store app is ready for the update, you can make a fresh release right now of the new Google Play app.
> * In the Learn Your Way section, Explore, Saved, and All are in the top tab for horizontal scroll in the Practice section. It's a good approach, but I don't know. It seems a bit confusing for a first-time visitor of the site.
> * When going to the Learn section, there should also be something like a CTA or an offer, a straight thing you can do, like actually learn some stuff. It should not show on top: "Just do today: 0 in, revise 0 mistakenly." Revise should not be 0. It should show "Start learning for the subject," "Your roadmap," or something like that. You can think about it.
> * Overall, the UI on the phone is a bit slow, and the website is also a bit slow.
> * One small thing I'll tell you, from which you can see what I'm saying: when I go to the Explore feed and start something there, the section is designed like an Instagram story thing, but I have to actually swipe down. For a first-time user, you have to somehow integrate this through the UI, or show some toggle or hover first time to nudge them that this is the way to operate it. These kinds of things you have to think about.
> * Overall, there is too much blank space, which can be utilized somehow, maybe.
> * When it is ended, there are also too many lines and walls of text everywhere. We should not have it.
> * I'll just go to the home page once, and I'll sign out.
> * The hero section design: love the direction, but maybe we can consume a bit less of the details space there, like 10%, 20%, and make it a bit more branded somehow, rather than this vague SVG and PNG integration. Maybe make it reactive on tapping something, tapping on the mobi or stuff like that. We had many assets for the animation and promotion videos that we used, so these kinds of things you can take care of.
> * Overall, right now our goal is to work on this feature and, again, keep making the entire UI/UX better to the point when you are satisfied with it. Not only the UI/UX, but the overall usefulness of every feature also.
> * Even if that part is done, you can start populating it more, like adding more cards and more things for the subjects. I think the content is not exactly populated for all subjects and chapters, so it should be at least fine, maybe 1 to 2 hours, 3 hours bare minimum for each subject. This is the bare minimum, even if a subject has 100+ hours of study content, and also it's not an issue.
> * Keep going. You have a bit of a direction and a taste of what I have wanted initially. Now you have to double down on it.

**Transcription guesses (confirm):**
- "Just do today: 0 in, revise 0 mistakenly" is probably the top status line, which reads something like "Today: 0 due · Revise 0 mistakes".
- "Learn Your Way" is the Learn home's heading or section.
- "I'll just go to the home page once, and I'll sign out" means he looked at the home page (the hero) signed out.

**Folded in** (OWNER-MASTER-LEDGER.md, section "Learn v2 live, 1 Nov afternoon"):

| ID | Item |
|---|---|
| LK24 | The phone website (web on a phone, not the app) is too cluttered. |
| LK25 | Ship a fresh Google Play release of the app as soon as the app update is ready. |
| LK26 | The Explore / Saved / All top tabs (horizontal scroll) confuse a first-time visitor. |
| LK27 | Learn opens with a clear offer to start learning ("Start learning <subject>", "Your roadmap"), never a status line full of zeros ("0 due, Revise 0"). |
| LK28 | The phone website and the website are slow. Make them fast. |
| LK29 | The Explore feed works like a story, but it moves by swiping down. A first-time user gets a nudge that shows how it works. Think about such first-time cues everywhere. |
| LK30 | Too much blank space; use it. |
| LK31 | End screens: too many lines and walls of text. |
| LK32 | Home hero: he loves the direction. Use 10-20% less space for the details. Make it more branded, with less vague SVG/PNG. Make it react to taps (for example on Mobi), using our animation and promo-film assets. |
| LK33 | Goal: keep improving this feature and the whole UI/UX, and the usefulness of every feature, until we are satisfied. |
| LK34 | Content: populate cards (and more) for every subject and chapter. At least 3 hours of study per subject is the bare minimum, and more is fine. |
| LK35 | Keep going, and double down on this direction. |

**Content calls still open:** the near-duplicate pair "Define partnership." / "What is partnership?", and the card "If this amount is paid to the old partners...". He did not answer them; the CTO decides in round 2 (LK35: keep going).

## 2 Nov 2026, about 10 am IST: his look at the live Learn v2 on the web, Light and Dark, phone and desktop, while 1.0.19+17 waits in Play review (verbatim, two messages)

> Coming on to the UI: the overall UI and everything, when I go to the account section, it looks good. It's quite detailed. All chapters are properly listed but I don't think that's true for all the subjects. Especially I feel like English: it's just the verbal ability. I don't know, either maybe it's not populated or something.
>
> If I click on "Directly Start 10 Minutes," it's not letting me alter it. If I click on any chapter then I can choose the key cards question but there should be a toggle allowing me to choose the number of key cards and questions and other stuff which I want to do. According to that it can adapt to something like your mistakes and all those kinds of stuff.
>
> Overall I'll start it and see how it is. When I click "Missed It," it's showing "To Revise" and "Open Mistakes 1" only. When I click "Missed It," nothing really happens. Can you explain to me what the "Missed It" button is doing? "Got It" and "Easy" both, I think, are doing the same. Both are adding cards to the "To Revise" section, like 3 to revise, 4 to revise. Those are also, I think, overall the same only, not doing anything. What's the purpose of any of this?
>
> I just feel like the UI of the cards can be a bit better. Right now I'm in light mode. I'll see it one time in dark mode also. The scroll and other small things, like in the section when I'm scrolling: in the question section it's not scrolling the page. I have to scroll outside the question section. Small UI things like this.
>
> Overall everything is very scaled down. There is so much white space, blank space on the desktop, overall everywhere in this thing. Now if I start a 5-minute... Even in dark mode the look of the cards can be improved somehow. They are very boring right now and can be made a bit interesting somehow.
>
> Genuinely people should be able to understand what these three options do. Misstate got it easy. Even I have attempted so many and I am unable to understand. Stuff like this you have to take care of and think about. Overall small UI/UX fixes which I told you about long back have to be done.
>
> In the top bar where it shows Pro, and I think it's credits, wallet symbol, all that is very low-quality, lower UI, which has to be fixed. In dark mode there is this neon light around every card, which is looking a bit too much and can be made a bit more subtle to give it less of a very extreme neon AI slop look.
>
> Going on to the Explore feed, the UI and overall direction that you have taken with this Explore feed is actually better. I just randomly noticed it while attempting many questions: how is the answer to every question just A? I'm randomly clicking, and every answer seems to be A to me. These are not shuffled, or this has to be some major glitch. Just C to me. This is a unique experience just to me. Literally, I have attempted many questions in different sections, different chapters. Every answer seems to be A

> Perform these changes you told me about. You can fix whatever fixes you told me about, like 2, 3, and 4.
>
> For the first one, 4 equal tabs seem okay to me on the web. No specific change but I'll just see it on the mobile app once, if there is anything.
>
> Overall I don't know why the scroll speed on the entire website feels like a lot. Is there any way we can slow it down? It's the issue in the first section of the website only. I don't know, this is a very small thing but I just thought I should mention it.
>
> I think you have copied the exact app UI to the web only. It's not an issue, overall it looks good but it's making the website even less dense, which I think enhances the overall experience. I think many options now are hidden or you are unable to access them. Let me just confirm if that's the case or not.
>
> I think the order maybe can be suggested as practice, then paper, then learn, then explore, rather than the current order. It's a minor thing but it's worth mentioning. The overall UI looks honestly fine only to me. Just the top nav bar can be redesigned and rethought, especially this wallet logo, which looks a bit weird, not as much on the web but still. Apart from that, no specific feedback from my side if anything else is required later.
>
> For the app, it's still in review by Google Play. I don't know how much time it will take. Most probably, I won't be able to give the review right now. Let me know if you need anything right now from my side.

"Fixes 2, 3 and 4" are the app port session's proposals of 2 Nov ~9:40 am: (2) the stop sheet and the end count the same thing; (3) the app's "Print sheet" row is named for what it opens; (4) a Revise run's head line says Revise, not the first card's chapter.
Found at once: the verified bank's keys are skewed to A (Accountancy 1,206 of 1,405; most older subjects alike; the Claude-authored waves are balanced). NTA papers shuffle options; quick papers, Learn v2, the Explore stream and Mob papers serve the stored order.

## 3 Nov 2026, about 1:30 pm IST: his look at the app on his phone, main account (verbatim)

> I was seeing the app. Overall, things look good to me. Only the UI part can be improved a bit in many places.
>
> There is something on my main account. It is always showing on every screen: "Sending your answer is computer science mock." What is this? It is some glitch which needs to be fixed.
>
> The practice section on the mobile app looks clean. Your papers and Learn are there, but there is no Flow feed, and the Learn section is still a bit cluttered. The UI needs a bit of improving. In the overall app, even though I really like the aspects which are implemented right, they can be a bit stronger and a bit more premium, something in the direction of Duolingo.
>
> Except for this, just keep noting whichever things you need my feedback on. I'll be back in 30, 40 minutes, and I'll give you that. Right now, just focus on the things that I just said and the things that you were doing yesterday before I stopped you. Continue doing all that, and when I'm back, I'll tell you whatever you need from my side.

"Sending your answer is computer science mock" is the app's live strip ("Sending your answers · Computer Science mock"; flutter_app/lib/core/widgets/bar/bar_live.dart BarSending). It shows whenever the latest local session draft has pendingSubmission and the phone is online (app_overrides.dart barSendingInputProvider), even after the submit window (endsAt + 120 s) has passed or after the token refresher gave up, so a stale draft keeps it up on every screen. "Flow feed" is the Explore feed (the web's fourth tab), which the app does not have yet.

## 3 Nov 2026, about 3:15 pm IST: his live look at the LAN preview (top bar, cards) on his phone (verbatim)

> It's opening on the phone now. It looks exactly the same as before. If the top bar mentions the barware graded and pro, then that's good, but the barware practice paper and explore are shown. There is no way to access the learn section exactly, and it's showing "Chapter feeds did not load." Guard look is the exact same as before. These are the areas of question for how this is going to work, but for now, stop everything. Just recall what I have said, and also you have added some intelligent recommendation. But it's making the overall UI very much more cluttered. Not exactly cluttered, I would say, but the implementation in the UI is just not good. Don't use these vague icons and stuff like this either. Make them into a proper branded icon, a generated image, or something else.
>
> Overall, the English that you write for everything, for sure, as I said, we want it to be improved. These are just small things which will overall need to be done. The mobile UI of the website is now somewhat an exact copy of the app, but the website has more features and needs to be a full-fledged experience. Just see how you will do it, especially the Learn thing, which I said is not visible in this specific version that you have sent me.
>
> Don't start doing anything right now. Just record everything that I said. I have to restart the PC once, then I'll be back, and then you can continue.

Reading (dictation): "barware" is likely "the bar where" (the top bar showing credits and Pro); "Guard look" is likely "Card look" (the card preview link looked the same as before). He opened http://192.168.1.8:3463 (the LAN preview from the app port session, r6-cards).


## 3 Nov 2026, about 11:55 pm IST: finish everything, then ship for real: a Play build and the live website, no prototypes (verbatim)

> What I want you to do is just keep going after everything that was specified in the form. Do that. Once you are done, just see the UI and the previous feedback that I had given. Upon that, keep working until you are satisfied with a good enough UI and fixture of everything.
>
> Once all is done from our side, don't give me prototype links or builds. Give me a final build which I can upload straight to Google Play, and deploy the final changes to the website, main website only, so that I can see everything properly on every device (rather than making some localhost links or some emulator builds). Leave all that.
>
> Also, just check for any uncommitted work or anything in the work. Please commit everything and make everything in the project final and up to date for right now, because I might have to transfer some things and focus on some onboarding stuff (onboarding of other members). So, up till today, all should have been recorded as a proper checkpoint. Again, just to inform: everything should be committed to get the final build for the Play Store app with all the fixes that we have been discussing for days. Everything then should be sent to

Reading: "the form" is likely the four lanes of the new-account prompt (A Physics, B app 1.0.20+18, C web, D English); "fixture" is likely "finish" or "fixing". The message ends mid-sentence at "should be sent to": asked him where (running question list).
What this changes: the rule "ship each web change only after his live look" is lifted for this round. He judges on the live site and the Play build; no LAN links, no prototype APKs. The CTO decides the UI against his past feedback (LK24-LK62) and ships it to www.mockmob.in after the usual gates (suites, eslint, both builds, the look at 390 and 1440 Night and Day, deploy check).

## 4 Nov 2026, about 2:05 am IST: the home page hero reads as AI slop; one scroll, one step; a stronger brand of our own (verbatim)

(With a screenshot of PowerShell in C:\Users\atish\Desktop\mockmob copy: `git push origin archive/uncommitted-1104-main:refs/archive/uncommitted-1104-main` -> "fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git", three times.)

> Firstly, that one command that you told me is returning this error.
>
> Now, coming onto the website, the hero section is starting to give me more and more of a slop vibe. There are many factors adding up to this:
>
> * In general, if you see the mobile animation of Mobby, tapping it, and changing that bubble, all that is a bit weird on mobile. It is completely missing from the hero section of desktop, so there is a huge parity issue between the hero sections of both.
> * The dark mode hero section has an extreme AI slop look because of too much neon highlighting, neon edges, that kind of stuff. You can research what AI slop looks like. That is happening here with us.
> * In the other parts, the desktop side feels way better than the mobile side. It lags a bit, and the scrolling feels very inconsistent. Sometimes it switches things, sometimes it doesn't. One rule should be: one action, one finger scroll. It should not detect speed. If I scroll very fast, it goes up extremely and skips many things. If I go slow, very slow, then it will do half a slide. It should have consistency in detecting what one single scroll is like, or think of something to fix that overall scroll thing.
> * In the hero section of mobile, more than half of the screen space is covered by just the mobi and stuff around it, but there is no mention of CUET or exams, or, in general, anything that tells the student anything about us. Mobi as a mascot is good, but the main hero section needs to have something more. I don't know if removing this or keeping this is the right direction, but it needs changing and refinement for sure.
> * As discussed previously, there are some AI flaw characteristics present clearly on the home page, which should not exist. Some of the text walls and stuff are too long, which again needs fixing. A small example is in the exam screen. I don't know what to do exactly in this. It's a bit too tall. We can't make it tall. It's fine but I don't know if the MockMob screen is exactly depicting the real MockMob screen or if it's just a copy. I don't know if we have, in our MockMob screen, also copied the exact NT interface. I think our interface should be better and unique and that NT-style interfaces went to copy exactly the NT interface.
> *  Anyway these are the small things that you have to take care of and refine upon automatically yourselves. Think this through and overall work on making a better stronger brand identity, not using AI slop.
>
> Typography and fonts: we don't have a huge AI slop problem on our overall landing page. Dark mode has a lot more issues, just inherently because of how the AI websites look. Still overall, I would rate the website for AI flop on overall brand assessment as 7/10 right now. Black mode especially is 6/10 but overall can be 7 or even 8/10 because the logo and all those things which we have fixed are very distinct and nice.
>
> Some fonts are really good with the MockMob word mark and MockMob mascot, and we are not using the extremely popular AI fonts like:
>    * Inter
>    * Ghost Sans
>    * Space Grotesque
>    * Plus Jakarta Sans
>    * Poppins
>    * DM Sans
>  Stuff like this. It's not like all is bad. Much stuff is good also. Overall, both in terms of the visuals and the stronger brand identity, we need to focus on the branding improvements, illustrations, typography hierarchy, and consistent use of mobi stuff, which will make it look like our own.
>
> Again, I will quote the example of Preprou website here. Even from the loading, they have a loading animation on the website when someone enters, and all the stuff is very refined. Even our typing animation is on. You can see how Preparoo does the typing animation on the home page. That's the direction we are looking forward to.

Reading (dictation): "Mobby" is Mobi; "AI flop" is "AI slop"; "Black mode" is Night (dark) mode; "Ghost Sans" is likely Geist Sans; "Space Grotesque" is Space Grotesk; "NT interface" is the NTA (exam) interface; "Preprou"/"Preparoo" is ug.preparoo.app (studied 4 Oct: MOBILE-REFINEMENT-PLAN-2026-10-04.md). The command failed because it ran in the parent folder, which is not a git repository (it must run in mockmob-next or with git -C).
His scores: overall brand vs AI slop 7/10; Night 6/10; the logo and wordmark are distinct and good; the fonts are not the common AI fonts (keep that).

## 4 Nov 2026, about 2:55 am IST: stop at 95% usage; handoff and a prompt for the next session (verbatim)

> Usage is at 95% right now, so start stopping everything and then prepare handoff along with the prompt for the next session. Make sure that no work is lost anywhere, everything is recorded, and stop at a safe checkpoint with all the understandings and the findings that you have got until now and the work that you have done.

Done in HANDOFF-2026-11-04-SINGLE-SESSION.md and PROMPT-NEXT-SESSION-2026-11-04.md.

## 4 Nov 2026, about 6:30 pm IST: after the PC restart, asks for a status, an ETA and what is needed from him (verbatim)

> Continue from where you left off and give me an update on what all is done, what's left, and by when everything that we discussed would be complete. Also, is there anything you need from my side right now?

Context: the session's agents stopped at 6:38 am when the 5-hour usage window ran out; the PC restarted at 6:24 pm. Answered in the session with done / left / ETA; nothing blocking is needed from him (ledger LK77).

## 4 Nov 2026, about 6:45 pm IST: the backup push is already done (verbatim)

> Everything is up to date related to the backup push. I was denied yesterday only.

Reading (dictation): "denied" is likely "done": he ran the 610 MB snapshot push himself yesterday. Verified: origin has refs/archive/uncommitted-1104-main at 117408243, the same commit as the local branch archive/uncommitted-1104-main. The item is closed; never ask him for it again (ledger LK78).

## 4 Nov 2026, about 6:50 pm IST: has anything been deployed? (verbatim)

> have you deployed anything anywhere? It is already live on mockmob.ai, but nothing seems changed to me. I don't think it's deployed, or can you confirm this and what you have exactly done? I was seeing some of the screenshots that you were seeing in between the charts. That website is looking different from what we have here right now

Reading (dictation): "mockmob.ai" is www.mockmob.in; "charts" is chats. Answer: only the small Learn fix (main ced6f747f, about 3:30 am) is live; the new home page in the screenshots is the mock-ups and the local build in progress, not deployed; it ships only after the full gate (ledger LK79).

## 4 Nov 2026, about 7 pm IST: speed up, finish, deploy, then tell him (verbatim)

> Right now, just speed up things. Fix everything that you need to do, deploy everything, and then let me know. Make sure the things, when I see them, are as perfect as they can be.

What this changes: no messages until it is all done and deployed (the Play build in its folder, the home page live and checked); work in parallel wherever it is safe; the quality bar stays (ledger LK80).

## 5 Nov 2026, about 2:25 am IST: yes, fix the slow-phone stutter on the Lab and tour (verbatim)

> Yes, fix it

(His answer to "Shall I fix the slow-phone stutter on the Lab and tour sections next?" Ledger LK81.)

## 5 Nov 2026, about 2:40 am IST: his look at the live mobile website; refine everything until morning (verbatim)

> Just some feedback I had while I was seeing the mobile website that you have deployed right now. It will not be much but I hope it will give you some direction to automatically keep improving everything continuously until tomorrow morning.
>
> * The CV2027 font and even the colors are a bit weird in the first place.
> * The main CTA is just "Try 5 questions".
> * Overall, the text within the line is uneven below, like "Pick yours free". All that is weird. Can we have better UI choices in that?
> * Overall, the hero section and other things can be improved a bit.
> * The scroll animation: previously, we had a mixture of white and green text in the scroll, which was very well branded, and that is gone now. That's one place where we need betterment.
> * You have mostly fixed the scroll thing, and even the nice UI things like some blur and motion when scrolling, and the icons that you have generated for what's inside Mockma. It's good, but some more thought can be given, especially to the part that you have added, like the preparo side.
> * The only issue is that when scrolling up, there are many times another CTA after CTA versions. That CTA implementation is not an issue, but CTA should be like sign up, log in, or something else, not just these five questions only.
> * Overall, whenever and wherever I click "Try a CUTE question," it sometimes gets stuck in a scroll loop. Or, when it's even not stuck, the implementation is just not clean. It is just a white box, and then it highlights and that thing. These are the small things which you can work upon.
> * The scroll is still a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it glitches out, and if I am scrolling really fast, it can then glitch out.
> * Moba NTS style: I think I like the previous one only better, because at least the valid URL was shown, which is now not accurate according to NTA mode.
> * We can attach some desktop photos or a mockup, something like that, on the website in this NTA section. Think of things, stuff like this.
> * Another small thing in the Energy section of the site: loading is a bit slow, not much, but still a bit.
> * When going to the Learn section, like in Computer Science, there is an option of B1 Computer Science or B2 Informative Practices. In Accountancy, students have to select between Analysis of Financial Statements or Comprehensive Accounting. Give these options and make them editable in Learn sections, okay? Wherever we have subjects like this where they have multiple options or they have to select only one, while onboarding, they should be asked just right there and all this should be clarified.
> * The cards look really nice, but some refinement, like turn over, is okay. I think it is good, not exactly an absolute 10 out of 10, but really good now. Even the Explore feed is working way better. My choices overall have improved a lot, but still, small improvements remain, which you can carry forward from the app, like the Pro plan descriptions, how to build UI exactly like the app, animations, and many other things.
> * With all these fixes also, you can then send me the final app and deploy everything to the website also.
> * Right now, I wasn't able to give you very detailed feedback. These are very small things only, I know, but hopefully you can make the most out of it.
> * I think clicking on the top profile previously used to show a small pop-up rather than taking you to the entire user section only. Maybe if you can do something like that with quick toggles, like changing the dark/light mode and stuff like that. Not very important, but it will be a nice touch.
> * Overall, I think you have focused a lot on branding and many things and stuff like that. Keep doubling down on it and think more about the feedback that I have given. What else can you improve even further
>
> keep going until morning, until you are satisfied with the result of the app and website both. Treat this as a proper refinement task, not just for the feature, but as an overall overhaul of the app and website and other aspects also related to what we have been discussing: UI/UX, branding, font, typography, all those kinds of stuff. If all that is done and I am not available to respond or give any feedback, then you can continue with adding things like populating the database with more questions, learn/practice modes, key Cards, and other things.

Reading (dictation): "CV2027" is the hero's "CUET 2027." brand line; "Mockma" is MockMob; "the preparo side" is the PrepOS / Ask Mobi part of the tour; "CUTE question" is "Try a CUET question"; "Moba NTS style" is the home page exam screen's MockMob / NTA switch; "Energy section" is most likely the DU Eligibility section (to confirm by measuring every section's load); "B2 Informative Practices" is Informatics Practices (CUET Computer Science, Section B1 or B2); "Comprehensive Accounting" is Computerised Accounting (CUET Accountancy Part B: Analysis of Financial Statements or Computerised Accounting); "My choices" is probably the multiple-choice questions. Ledger rows LK82-LK98. What this changes: refine (never rebuild or cut) the website and the app through the night, ship each verified piece live, build a new Play build with the fixes, and only when all of it is done and he is away, add content (questions, Learn, Key cards) under the budget guard.

## 5 Nov 2026, about 10 am IST: hero, brand, Day green, scroll, pricing and value framing; content approved (verbatim)

> I'll give you some feedback on what's there and what's not. You have implemented the new CTS system but overall the hero section needs a bit more refinement. If you see the prepro landing page or some other sort, it's a bit cleaner and better in some ways.
>
> Everything should be branded properly, like "5 versions free" and "73 TV programs." All this kind of stuff should be shown properly, removed, or utilized better. In light mode there is an issue: the green is everywhere, extremely light, and a very different color than how it used to be and than the brand color is. I don't know the reason why this happened but this also needs fixing. Especially your marks slipped somewhere. Mock Mob shows you where so the Mock Mob needs to be in green also. Just take care of all these things yourself.
>
> Why does the card, when scrolling down, right now snap to the entire bottom of the phone? Rather than that, below, like 10-20%, as the prepro site has done, we can add some sort of a blur or a leading downloader or something. There should be a clear way to skip to the bottom or top.
>
> Firstly the Mob logo on the top should be working so that somebody can click it and go to the top, and there should be something for the bottom also. This Walk, What's Inside Walk Mob, is still a bit glitchy in terms of animation and stuff that it shows: sometimes it's not glitchy and sometimes it is.
>
> The entire mode screen and all that you have done, I like it in the desktop version. If we could somehow integrate the mobile version also because this is just too small to see on mobile. It's good as a reference point but if you can implement something tastefully again.
>
> There is, again, a random card below it, like 5,700 questions, 1570 subjects, 99 per month. Relevance is less but they are just there. In many places branding has been removed and everything has become a lot plainer, like the "Featured by CUT creators" and many other things in general on the landing, which I have been noticing.
>
> The pricing section at the bottom can also be a bit cleaner. Again I'll reference how Prepro does it. The separate pricing page that you have made is really good so something like that can be implemented on the normal page also. Just the one plan, everything in it.
>
> The part below with the referral code, overall, that screen can be improved a bit, like the final card. Some things there need to be thought through a bit. I was seeing that many sites are doing this these days: making people realize a bigger amount as a small amount, like we do. We are not dealing with a bigger amount that we show people, something like ₹22 per day or something like that. We can do something like "How many mocks will you do on average per day per month?" or something like that. And we can have a toggle in which people can select, according to how many mocks they will do, the kind of value that they can extract out of the plan (like ₹1 per mock, ₹2 per mock, or just something like that).
>
> Also while comparing it to the other platforms, show that on platform X you pay 5,500 for this. Meanwhile on our platform, you say this much. If you're getting my point, what kind of comparison am I talking about? Some things like that need improving.
>
> Again if I can see the prepare site, then it would be good. Many things to write, like having the loading animation everywhere and the overall look being very clean. Along with that we can add something related to our flashcard section also, in the same way the pricing card and other things have a glassmorphism effect, stuff like that.
>
> I think you have some direction from my side related to this. Other things: the content part that you didn't start because I needed an okay from me. Have my okay for downloading any NCR that you need or doing anything else that you want to. Just let me know if you need my feedback on anything else or if there is something left to do.
>
> Lastly keep in mind this is very small and concise feedback on just some things that I was able to see, to give you some direction. Just understand the kind of things I'm saying and implement other things also according to this on your own because I wasn't able to see each and every change or thing that you did

Reading (dictation): "CTS" is the CTAs; "prepro" / "prepare site" is Preparoo (ug.preparoo.app); "5 versions free" and "73 TV programs" are the hero's second beat "Five questions free" and "73 DU programmes"; "Mock Mob" is MockMob; "a leading downloader" is most likely a loading/progress indicator; "Mob logo" is the MockMob logo in the site bar; "What's Inside Walk Mob" is the tour "What's inside MockMob"; "mode screen" is the exam screen with its MockMob / NTA style switch; "5,700 questions, 1570 subjects, 99 per month" is the numbers band (5,765 questions, 15 subjects, ₹99); "CUT creators" is "Featured by CUET creators"; "NCR" is NCERT. Ledger rows LK99-LK114. What this changes: a third refinement round on the home page (Preparoo-level clean, brand back everywhere, Day green fixed, held stories leave room at the bottom with a progress cue, top/bottom shortcuts, a tasteful phone exam screen, the pricing section as the pricing page's one plan with value framing and an honest comparison, a glass Key cards section); and the content lane is approved, including NCERT downloads.

## 5 Nov 2026, about 11:10 am IST: Accountancy keeps both Part B choices (verbatim)

> Keep both choices

(His answer to "Should Accountancy onboarding keep offering Computerised Accounting?" Onboarding keeps AFS and CAS; AFS stays the default with the line that the 2025 paper asked AFS only. Ledger LK115.)

## 5 Nov 2026, about 3:50 pm IST: stop; what is left, what is needed from him, what is done (verbatim)

> So, I have you stop working. What is left, and what is needed from my side right now? And what all is done?

(Answered with the status; nothing left running. Ledger LK116.)

## 5 Nov 2026, about 3:55 pm IST: why have you stopped? (verbatim)

> I was asking: why have you stopped working?

(Clarifies 3:50 pm: he asked why work stopped, not to stop. Ledger LK116 updated.)

## 5 Nov 2026, about 11:40 pm IST: the full website feedback and the app feedback; keep going, hand off near the limit (verbatim)

> Now I'll give you the entire feedback on the website and everything. Don't worry about the weekly limits. They don't affect you specifically that much. In a particular session even if only 10% of the weekly usage remains, that's easily one whole 5-hour limit session.
>
> Moving on to the main thing: the website feedback.
>
> Firstly talking about the main first hero section: on mobile it looks, I would say, good enough. On desktop the main issue is that there is too much white space and blank space. You can do it like Prepro has done it. Everything should be massive, clearly visible, and enforced to a proper desktop size. It should cover the entire screen with not even a single little blank space. There is some blank space but only where it's needed, like very minor margins on the sides. We have too much blank space everywhere. Even if you are unable to cut down the blank space because you will just be adding text or making it bigger, it still won't do it. Some sort of texture or stuff needs to be in the background, like we had previously. It looks fine in white mode, but in black mode the black space, or whatever I should call it, is even more significant.
>
> Again, the green in the light mode is still not how it exactly should be. For the rest, the entire major issue, I would say, is how things are formatted. I would again reference the PrepAr website you have researched many times, but it's not just that website. Every website is optimized for mobile and desktop both. I don't think you have optimized it for desktop right now, so I'll shift to mobile right now and give my feedback there only. The mobile website is better in terms of the hero section. Still no texture or highlighting of the CVT stuff. How do they do it? By making the main CVT and IPMAT thing the typing animation but we can't do it. Also the typing animation says "sometimes there, sometimes it's gone" on the home page so I don't know what is exactly true. What's the reason for this?
>
> Just make sure to remove these random texts filled everywhere. The "Have an account? Log in" part is okay but 5,700 questions, free to standard, pro, 99 months: too much information just on the top. This is not a good UI/UX choice.
>
> The question slide, which is below: "Hi I'm Mobby. Your first question: go. What kind of English is this?" I mean it's not about the grammar or anything but just think from a marketing angle and, in general, also how to write copy properly.
>
> The questions again: there should be an option of "Not your subject?" or something like that. I don't know how to implement it tastefully but you have to do that. If someone selects their questions and all, then we can show random 5 questions from the bank of those specific subjects.
>
> The 5 main features that you are highlighting, like "5 questions free," are again very useless. We are already saying that at the top. "73 DU programs" could be, but again is this the number that we are offering? 15 subjects so they make you qualified for 73 programs or what? You have to highlight the main 5 features or something relevant or you can just remove this. I don't know what exactly. "₹99 per month" is okay but even more interesting could be adding something like "as low as ₹1 per mock" or something like that, if you get my point.
>
> When I am scrolling down to this section, "Your mark slipped somewhere. MockMob shows you where," MockMob is not green inherently. It turns green after scrolling so it's looking very weird there. These kinds of things you have to keep in mind as I said before also.
>
> When I come to the Mistake Lab, most screens are good. This Repair one is a bit too clustered for the mobile screen and Swap one also but it's overall fine. The Skip button on mobile is good. With the Score Recovery Lab you have done exactly what I wanted but there is again too much white space between some things and sections of the page, on mobile also.
>
> This key cards thing that you have done looks cool. The implementation is also good. It can be just refined a bit more. I don't know how exactly but something. Again white space and blanks everywhere. If you try to remove links I don't mean for everything to get listed, just make it proper.
>
> Practice, Calm, then Rehearse. Exam Day, you have degraded this a lot. This is not how we wanted it. The last one was really good, the rest of them and our original one were also good but this, what you have done right now, just won't work. Revert back to this or make a proper implementation of how I want you to do it.
>
> The only thing that you have done perfectly, I would say, is this Pro thing. Just R is covering the Pro a bit too much so make it a bit lower. I would like more of the Pro to be visible. It's visible in the dark mode but in the light mode it's not properly visible. Try to just move it down a bit.
>
> Then when I'm at "What a Mock Cost at Your Base," this is good, how I wanted you to do it. Overall this section can be refined a lot in terms of UI and how we are presenting it. Even the lowest thing that we are doing, like 2 mocks per week, is just too low. We need to be able to make them believe that they should practice more mocks or just make them seem more useful than they are. Make it in such a way that even the lowest bar makes the students think that they are doing too low right now. If they are practicing 1 mock or 2 mocks a week, that's too low. They should be doing 5 or 7 a week at least so that our pricing is more attractive, less than ₹10 a mock, like that.
>
> The final thing in the slider should be: 14 a week is a lot and still we are above ₹1,000. I don't know what exactly we can do to show it as even less than ₹1,000. We don't exactly have to show it but it would be a cool catch.
>
> Then they should provide what each costs to me, 2027. Again very vague and bad English. What have you even written here? I don't understand it myself. Mock, Mock Pro, 7 months into 99, okay.
>
> In All Access, CVT Codes, ScienceNow, you have had to show a comparison and you have failed in terms of UI. In the sources how the hell can you mention stuff like Preparo or Ofer? We can't directly compare to them legally. I don't know if this is even allowed: to mention other websites, places like this, and compare. Just remove this completely.
>
> The pricing button at the top should not take you to the pricing on the landing page. It should take you to the pricing page itself. There also at the end, the bottom one, plan everything. That's the stuff with how you have made it. Refine it to how it is on the home page.
>
> Other than that the pricing page is really good in terms of everything: Pro Unlocks and stuff like that. Just the final last slide. We can make it something like Free or Pro, something like that. Just think about it.
>
> Another thing which I remembered on the home page is that this bar below, which comes up, is not properly made: "Login and sign up for free." Firstly, spacing issue, UI/UX issues, and other than that, the CTA is a bit weak. Coming to the Learn section. For accounts, I was noticing one thing: there is an option between Analysis of Financial Statement and Computerized Accounting, which mainly affects the last one or two chapters only. Accounting for Share Capital Issue and Retention of Dividends: all this is unaffected. I know this, as CUET treats this as Part 1 and Part 2. In Class 12, there are three separate books for this.
>
> Just cross-check how you have done it and whether it is the right approach. I am not seeing any issue with it. Just cross-check everything.
>
> The cards, if possible on the web also, can have some functionality like Got It, Missed, or Easy. Maybe some swipe functionality, like Got It to the right, Easy down, and Missed left, something like that. If you can implement it, it is just a cool thing.
>
> I have been seeing that these kinds of things might not be useful to anyone, but you should always think and keep adding these kinds of refinements without me telling you these things again and again. Even the chapter lists and all are all right. You have even added the search functionality, so the search functionality is cluttered in this. This is off, right? Show Answer: this toggle is broken. It is very weird. I don't know how to show this to you. It is showing chapters and cards instead of what it should show if someone wants to search a chapter. That is one thing.
>
> Overall, the Learn section I visited before also is a bit clunky and needs refinement. When I click on the U section button, it is not opening the entire U section. When I click on the top icon where my profile is situated, where A is written, it is opening the entire U section. It is actually doing the opposite of what it should be doing, of what I think a UI should do. Think about that also.
>
> Overall, Arena is still pretty much the same. I didn't tell you exactly what to do, but it is not very impressive with anything. Today Practice and Everything still feel a bit too limited. Many things are still not as easy to use as I want them to be. I don't know if even you can do anything in that, but I completely forgot how we have implemented that Ask Mob thing. I think that is completely gone from the UI. I can't find it anywhere exactly. Actually, what happened to that? That was one of our main features, and it had to be the entire AI layer of the system. I don't know, due to clutter or what, it's completely gone now. Do you have any plan for what you can do to bring it back?
>
> I think that's all for the website end. For the app,
>
> for the app, I'll tell you what I like and what needs improvement.
>
> * Haptics: you have improved them a lot, but in some places they can still be improved. In the tutorial section of Mob, adding haptics there, maybe. I'm not sure but it could be a good thing.
> * Seeing the explore feed on mobile: really good, very fluid. Even the line feed looks a bit better on mobile. I don't think that I have any huge recommendation for that. It already looks really nice. Maybe just make stuff, by the way, greener and better. Whatever you can do, but not much. It already looks very good.
>
> I think focus can now be shifted more towards the website, like 80% towards the website and 20% maybe to the app. Still keep on making it better and focus on the website, both on the desktop, mobile, tablet, and laptop experience, everything as a whole.
>
> Many things on the arena side of the desktop are good. The feed and all cover more of the screen and are not an issue, so it's honestly fine. Just as I said, the sidebar is lower than all UI refinement stuff is required. I think that's all for the feedback. Let me know if you need anything else from my side.
>
> .f something is left. When you are close to hitting it, I said to myself, "Went to stop and prepare handoff so that I can continue another account," but for now, keep going.

Reading (dictation): "Prepro"/"PrepAr"/"Preparo" is Preparoo; "CVT" is CUET; "Mobby" is Mobi; "free to standard, pro, 99 months" is the fact line "Free to start, Pro ₹99 a month"; "Mistake Lab ... Swap" is probably the SWOT scene; "R is covering the Pro" is the plan card covering the big "Pro" word; "Your Base" is "your pace"; "above ₹1,000 ... less than ₹1,000" most likely means ₹1 a mock; "Ofer" is Oswaal (or the offer rows); "U section" is You; "Ask Mob" is Ask Mobi; "the line feed" is the Learn feed; "Went to stop and prepare handoff so that I can continue another account" means: when close to the usage limit, stop and prepare a handoff so he can continue on another account. Ledger rows LK117-LK147.

## 6 Nov 2026, about 12:30 am IST: usage at 90%, stop and hand off; a temporary model trial with GPT-6 Terra (verbatim, summary of a long message)

> Okay, your usage is at 90% right now, so you can start to stop agents and the work being done. Slowly add a save checkpoint ... then prepare a handoff and prompt as usual, but one thing will be different this time. I am now a bit keen on testing different models' abilities ... maybe even trying out smaller models like GPT-6.1Terra ... just for the sake of my curiosity and research. I'll do a run with GPT-6T until I get to 100% usage on that ChatGPT account. Then you can maybe calculate what all it did and how much work it actually got done in that session as compared to what you have been doing ... all this should not affect our main project or the release of anything. This should just be a side markdown file ... for a few, 2, 3 days ... in the prompt that you give me for the next session, just make sure that all our structures and everything are intact ... Let me know ... if there is some risk associated with not getting maybe the best quality out of it ... if what we are handing to the next agent ... contains something which requires some sort of higher thinking, reasoning, or finding out the problem which is not clearly described ... Opus 5.5 will remain our primary model for a long time ... don't make any standing instructions, any rules ... which will hamper the thinking level that Opus has ... Maybe in the future, we can explore setting up a workflow of both smaller and larger models.
